**This explains how to conduct an Open decision-making process that is inclusive and properly recorded by using an email list.**

It is a core principle of Open Source projects that discussions and decisions need to be conducted transparently.
Even though most decisions are reversible, a transparent decision process helps prevent the need to reverse decisions and sooth hurt feelings.

1. **Wherever you are having a discussion, have the discussion.**
  - For example, we have many discussions in GitHub issues and pull requests, so we can keep the relevant conversation tied to the relevant artifact (code, content).
  - Conversations naturally arise in chat and might flow over the course of hours or days.
  This is natural and good.
2. **Start an email thread when you realize you've got something under discussion that affects other people.**
   - It may not always be obvious who is affected or will care, so the practice is to  think about how to be inclusive of those people anyway.
   - Starting a thread on the mailing list is a single-step with positive outcomes and impacts, which sometimes are quite significant.
3. **Discussion may happen in more locations—even private ones—if that is needeed to reach consensus.**
  - The thread can be a pointer to where the discussion and work is happening, and/or it may move to or continue on the mailing list as well.
4. **Keep the email thread updated to give people an opportunity to discover and join the discussion before decisions are made.**
  - If discussion is happening in a GitHub issue, update the email thread with the current consensus thinking, problems to be solved, etc.
  - A good practice is to give at least three days after providing an update for people to discover and absorb what is going on, and to respond if needed.
  Typically weekends don't count in this because of the number of contributors who are not reading email on the weekends.
5. **Once your discussion has resulted in a recommended decision, take that to the mailing list.**
  - It's a good practice to close the thread with a pointer at the conclusion of the issue, PR, Slack thread, etc.

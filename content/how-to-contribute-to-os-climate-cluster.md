## Contribution process

Your contribution starts with an idea, a question, or a problem identified (e.g. a bug in the software).

* If you have an idea in a form that is ready to be considered as-is, such as a change to a configuration file, you can use a Pull Request.
* If you want to propose and discuss an idea, you can use an Issue.
(TBD make an issue template.)
* If you are filing a bug report, you can use the Issue template for that.

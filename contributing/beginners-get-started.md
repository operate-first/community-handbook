## Good first contributions to the [handbook repository][1]:
* Fix a typo by making a pull request (PR) against the repo
* Flag documentation that is confusing or needs improvement: select **Issues** > **New issue** > **Poor documentation**
* Create an issue for any documentation that should be added to the handbook: select **Issues** > **New issue** > **Missing documentation**

This page (AKA "README file"[^1]) is to help you get started using or contributing to the Operate First (Op1st) project.

**Users** are typically interested in doing work with the tools available in the Op1st community cloud.
This page will guide you in understanding what those tools are and how to access them, along with some documentation and pointers to more comprehensive materials.

**Contributors** may also be doing work with the tools in the community cloud, but they are also interested in participating as a contributor.
Contributions come in many forms, and from contributors of all experiences levels.

Contributions may take such forms as: content (like this webpage), user help, cloud operations with GitOps, cloud configuration suggestions, blogging, giving talks, presenting on meetup and video series, writing code, figuring out where code needs to be written and enabling others to write the code, and so manmy more

Regardless of why you are here, you may ultimately be seen as a contributor.
Users who bring workloads to the community cloud can be helping the underlying project purpose of gaining AI/ML insights from the observability of that workload running in an all-open source cloud.

## Getting started as a user

- Have pathways for types of user? Or just be generic?
  - Key Persona Question:  What do OS-Climate users need right now?

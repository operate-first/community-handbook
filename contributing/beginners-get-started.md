# Beginner's guide to getting started as a contributor

If you're looking to become a handbook contributor but aren't sure where to start, you've come to the right place.

## Good first contributions to the [handbook repository][1]:
* Fix a typo by making a pull request (PR) against the repo
* Flag documentation that is confusing or needs improvement: select **Issues** > **New issue** > **Poor documentation**
* Create an issue for any documentation that should be added to the handbook: select **Issues** > **New issue** > **Missing documentation**
* Work on [issue #67][10] in the community repo, which concerns auditing barriers to contribution.
If you encounter anything in the project that prevents you from contributing, let us know.
We want to lower these barriers as much as we can, so knowing about them is crucial!
